The most important thing first:

!!! note
    We always document workflows, code, and tools

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, and it is essential that all workflows, tools,
and processes used in this project are thoroughly documented.
This ensures that other researchers can accurately reproduce experiments and validate the findings.
Clear and detailed documentation enables new contributors to understand the methodologies and
replicate the results without ambiguity.
Whether it involves software dependencies, data preprocessing steps, or execution instructions,
every aspect must be described comprehensively.
